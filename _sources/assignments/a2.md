Assignment 2: Chatting with Friends
============================

## Introduction

The primary learning outcome for a1 was to provide you with an opportunity to learn how to work with modules from the Python Standard Library, explore recursive functions, and gain familiarity with error handling. 

For assignment 2, you are going to build upon your code from the a1 program, by creating a local-first journaling program. This means that your journal entries will be stored locally (on your computer) with an option to be shared to the Internet. Where on the Internet? Any server that supports the ICS32 distributed social platform (DSP) (for now that's just me)! 

### Summary of Program Requirements 

1. Manage user data using a file store
2. Design a command line user interface
3. Write code to support a communication protocol
4. Write code to communicate with a remote server over web sockets

### Learning Goals

1. Working with modules
2. Integrate existing code into a program
3. Communicating with networks and sockets
4. Working with protocols

## Program Requirements

Unlike the previous assignment, you will have a lot more flexibility in how you design your program's user interface. I will not be providing a validity checker for this assignment, so the input and output of your program is largely up to you. However, there are some conditions:

1. You must _retain_ the functionality specified for a1. The a1 validity checker should still pass when run against your a2 assignment (except for the filename, obviously). You must also retain the input command format for any new commands your program may need (HINT: an input command processor would make a good module!), which if you recall looks like this:
 
```ipython3
[COMMAND] [INPUT] [[-]OPTION] [INPUT]
```

2. You must use the Profile.py module that accompanies this assignment without modification (more on that below).
3. You must divide your program into __at least three modules__, not including the Profile module.

Otherwise, you are free to design your program any way you like.

The program you will be creating is divided into two parts. I strongly encourage you to read through both parts so that you have a clear picture of what the complete program will do. Then focus on completing part 1 first. Ensure that part 1 is reliably working before continuing on to part 2.

### Part 1

Your program should extend the create command that you built in a1. When a user enters the create command, not only will your program create a new DSU file, but it will also use inputs to collect additional data from the user. The collected data should be contained in a Profile object until the user ends the program, at which time the data should be saved to the user created DSU file.

```{admonition} Program Feature

Extend the 'C' create DSU file command to collect profile information about the user and store the profile information using the Profile module.

```

<a href="../resources/Profile.py">The DSU Profile Module</a>

You must use the Profile module (linked above) to store the data you collect from the user. The Profile module has two primary functions: 1) Provides properties to store user input, and 2) Provides encode and decode functions to support saving profile data to a DSU file. To understand how to use Profile module, you will be required to study the code that it contains. Your user interface should collect all of the data represented by the properties in the Profile module.

```{admonition} Code Reading Tip
:class: tip

Asking questions and working together is a critical component to a successful development team. So rather than tell you exactly how to use the Profile class, I want you to help each other figure it out. Although you are **not allowed** to share the code you write for this assignment with each other, you are allowed to share what you learn about the Profile module. My only requirement is that you do so publicly using the a2-qa channel in Slack. I will keep an eye on conversation and make sure you all head in the right direction.

```

Your program should allow a user to search for and load a DSU file using the input command conventions established in a1. While you should have the search functionality already in place, you will need to add support for loading a DSU file. 

```{admonition} Program Feature

Add new command to user interface to support loading DSU files.

```

As you might recall, in a1 you performed a very similar operation when you implemented the 'R' command. We don't want to change the behavior of the 'R' command, as there may be conditions in which a user might like to check the contents of a DSU file before loading it. Therefore, you will need to create a new input command to support loading an existing DSU file. There are two ways to approach this task: 1) create a new input command (e.g., 'O [path].dsu') or 2) add a load option to the 'R' command (e.g., 'R [path].dsu -l'). The choice is yours, but be sure to inform the user about how they should go about loading a DSU file!


Finally, as this program will be growing in complexity for the rest of the quarter, you should start getting used to writing tests. A good place to start is to ensure that your program is properly loading and saving profile data after it has been supplied by the user.

### Part 2

Now that you have a program that can successfully store and retrieve user input, it's time to do something with it! For the second part of this assignment, you will be connecting to a server and sending the user data you have collected in Part 1 to the world wide web. You will do this by using web sockets. Web sockets behave very much like the network sockets that we will discussing in lecture and labs.

To use websockets, you will need to import the websockets module. Additionally, because connection speed and reliability is often times inconsistent, it will be important to use asynchronous communication to avoid our program from locking up while it waits for server responses. Therefore, you will need to use the asyncio module to wrap the send and receive logic in your program. The following code snippet represents a basic websocket communication program. You are free to use this code as a template to get you started.

```ipython3
import asyncio
import websockets

async def main():
	uri = "ws://localhost:8080/ws"
	async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:

		message = input("What is your message?")

		await websocket.send(message)
		print(f"> {message}")

		response = await websocket.recv()
		print(f"< {response}")
																								
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())

```

```{admonition} Program Feature
Connect to, send, and receive information with a remote DSP server
```

When communicating with a server using sockets, it is common to establish a protocol for exchanging messages. A protocol is a predefined system of rules to transfer information between two or more systems. For a2, your program will need to support the DSP protocol to successfully communicate with the DSP server.

The DSP protocol supports the following send commands:

join
: Accepts either an existing user and password, or a new user and password

post
: Accepts a journal post for the currently connected user

bio
: Accepts a user bio, either adding or replacing existing user bio


All protocol messages must be sent in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. All responses from the DSP server will be in JSON format as well.

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

You don't have to concern your self too much with JSON for this class. However, if you would like to learn more about JSON and why it is a great format for storing and transporting data, visit:

<a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON.org</a>

```

The following code snippets demonstrate how each of the DSP commands should be wrapped in JSON. You are free to adopt these templates for your program.

```ipython3
# join as existing or new user
{"join": {"username": "ohhimark","password": "password123"}}


# timestamp is generate automatically in the Profile module using Python's 
# time.time() function
{"post": {"entry": "Hello World!","timestamp": "1603167689.3928561"}}


# for bio, you will have to generate the timestamp yourself or leave it empty.
{"bio": {"entry": "Hello World!","timestamp": "1603167689.3928561"}}
```

The DSP protocol also supports response commands:

error
: Will be received when a send command is unable to be completed

ok
: Will be received when a send command is successful

Your program should expect one of these two responses after sending a command. The following code snippet demonstrates how the response command should be wrapped in JSON. Again, you are free to adopt this template for your program.

```ipython3

# Error messages will primarily be received when a user has not been 
# established for the active session. For example, sending 'bio' or 'post' 
# before 'join'
{"response": {"type": "error", "message": "An error message will be contained here."}}

# Ok messages will be receieved after every successful send command. 
# They likely will not be accompanied by a message.
{"response": {"type": "ok", "message": ""}}
```

```{admonition} Program Feature
Adapt the DSP protocol for use in your program (HINT: could make for a good module!)
```

A typical exchange between a program and a DSP server might look like the following:

```ipython3

message = '{"join": {"username": "ohhimark","password": "password123"}}'
await websocket.send(message)

response = await websocket.recv()
print(response)
	
>>> {"response": {"type": "ok", "message": ""}}
```

In your Python code, you will treat JSON messages as type string. In the snippets above, you will likely need to replace the hard coded values (_e.g.,_ hohimark, password123, etc.) with the variables in your program that store the actual data you intend to send to the DSP server. There are many ways to do this, but you should focus your efforts on using the string formatting functions found in the Python Standard Library.

Finally, if you have made it this far, you are probably wondering about the information required to connect to the DSP server. I am still testing the server, but will have it up and running very soon. In the meantime, I will be creating a temporary echo server that you can use to develop your protocol handling code. Check back here or wait for an announcement in Slack about the location of these servers. Since this project page is public and I would like to avoid undesirable traffic aimed at our course server, I will be communicating server details via Slack only.

You may also be wondering, what happens to all the messages you send...Well, since we are using websockets, you may have guessed, all of your messages will be published to a web page on the course website. So be kind and respectful in the messages you write!
