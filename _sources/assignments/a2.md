Assignment 2: Journal
===================================

## Introduction

The goal for [assignment 1](a1.md) was to learn how to work with the Python Standard Library, use recursion, and start to familiarize yourself with error handling. If you were able to complete all of the requirements for assignment 1, you should now have a fully functional command line program that allows you to find, create, read, and delete files on your computer. 

Though useful, so far your program doesn't offer any functionality that is not available from existing command line tools already on your computer. So for assignment 2, you are going to extend your a1 code to enable a user to capture their thoughts by writing journal posts and storing them in a text file. You will use the features that you implemented in [a1](a1.md) to provide the basic file management and user interface aspects of your new program while you add new features to support basic journaling and journal management functionality. 

### Summary of Program Requirements 

1. Manage user data using a file store
2. Design a command line user interface
3. Implement a custom file format using JSON (Javascript Object Notation)

### Learning Goals

1. Working with modules
2. Integrate existing code into your program
3. Improving error handling
4. Working with JSON
