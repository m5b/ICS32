Assignment 2: Extending the Platform
============================

## Introduction


### Summary of Program Requirements 


### Learning Goals


## Program Requirements

1. Create an account at: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up
	1. If you are prompted to input a reason, just enter UCI and Education/Science.
2. Find your API by clicking the "API Keys" link on your account page. Copy your API key and store it somewhere (as a comment in your code, for example).
3. Next visit the https://openweathermap.org/current current weather page. Read through the instructions and build your API call. A basic call should look like this:
	1. api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip={zip code},{country code}&appid={API key}
	2. You will need to customize this based on your personal preferences.
4. Once complete, add your api call to your program code as a comment, for now.

### Find your own API

Using the approach in part 1, you will now need to find and implement your own API.


### Integrate your API's into your ICS32 Distributed Social Program

Wow, awesome! How cool would it be if your users could enter a keyword into their posts to include third-party information? For this part of the assignment, you will be required to update your user interface to support keywords that work with the weather API and your custom API.

### Extra Credit

We will be awarding 1 extra credit point for the successful inclusion of a third API. If you choose to add a third API, you must explicitly define how to use it in your program and let us know via submission page comment that you would like to us to review your third API for extra credit.

### How we will grade your submission
																		
This assignment will be graded on a 12-point scale, with the 12 points being allocated completely to whether or not you submitted something that meets all of the above requirements. The following rubric will be used:

Requirements and Function | 10 pts
: Does the program do what it is supposed to do?
: Are there any bugs or errors?

Quality and Design        | 2 pts 
: Is the code well designed?
: Is the code clearly documented?

By now you should be clearly documenting your code and expending effort to ensure that your code design follows the conventions we have been discussing throughout the class. Therefore, we will be taking a much stricter stance on quality and design than we have in previous assignments.
