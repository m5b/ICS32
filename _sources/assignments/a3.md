Assignment 3: Publishing Online
============================

## Introduction

A journaling program, like the one you built for [assignment 2](../a2.md) is a nice way to record and manage personal information. However, there may be some occasions when your users want to share their thoughts with a broader audience. So for this assignment, you will be introducing an __online__ option to your program that allows your users to publish individual posts to a remote server where others can read what they have to say.

This means that your journal entries will be stored locally (on your computer) with an option to be shared to the Internet. Where on the Internet? Any server that supports the ICS32 distributed social platform (DSP) (for now that's just us)!

If you would like to take a quick look at the ICS32 DSP website, feel free to click through to the website:

[ICS32 Distributed Social](http://ics32distributedsocial.com)

The ICS32 DSP website is where you can view user posts published by your program. You don't need to do anything with this website in your program, it's simply here so that you can verify that posts published through your program are successful. Alright, so let's get started!
