Assignment 3: Extending the Platform
============================

## Introduction
In assignment 2, you learned how to write a program that connects to and shares information with a program running on another computer. The systems we write programs for today are almost always connected to other computers in some capacity. Whether it is your computer operating system sending data back to its creator, your web browser automatically downloading updates, or you reaching out to friends and family for a video chat, nearly all the programs we use today rely on networked communication to extend their capabilities.

While your Distributed Social (DS) program has the ability to accept, store, and distribute information written by your users, it doesn't yet take advantage of the vast wealth of information available to networked programs today. So for this assignment we are going to be extending the DS platform by adding some new features for the users of your program.
