Assignment 5: Encrypted Graphical User Interface
============================

## Introduction
So we have finally arrived at the end. Over the course of the last four assignments you have built, from the ground up, a feature rich program in Python. The code that you have written enables a person to write personal journal entries, publish entries to an online server, and enrich journal entries with data from web API's. Now it's time to bring all of these features together by moving them from the command line to the windowed world of the graphical user interface.

However, for the past two months, partnering organizations (e.g., ICS 32 students :) ) have been raising concerns over the poor security and privacy of the ICS 32 Distributed Social platform. In response to the concerns raised by its partners, the ICS32 Distributed Social organization (e.g., ICS 32 instructors) has implemented a new authentication scheme. Rather than rely on a user name and password, users will now be required to supply an [ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) public-key with each message. Additionally, all messages sent to the server must be encrypted with the DSP server's public key.

So for this assignment you will need to update your program to support the new authentication process for the DSP server and integrate your existing code into a new graphical interface using the Tkinter graphical toolkit. 

### Summary of Program Requirements
* Subclass the Profile class in your DS program to support encryption and public key authentication.
* Read and understand documentation for a 3rd party library.
* Update your DS program to communicate with the new DS Server.
* Modify and extend the ICS 32 DS Demo Tkinter interface.
* Integrate existing code with Tkinter widgets.
* Modify and update Tkinter widgets to display program information to a user.

### Learning Goals
* Use inheritance to extend class functionality
* Install and use 3rd party libraries
* Learn how to build basic Graphical User Interfaces with Tkinter and Python.
* Write event handlers and callback functions.
* Structure and organize a GUI program with classes.

## Program Requirements


### Part 1

The ICS32 Distributed Social organization has decided to implement the [NaCl](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/) networking and encryption library to help strengthen the security of its social messaging platform. Rather than implement the NaCl specification directly, the DS org will use a 3rd party library that is already written in Python called [PyNaCl](https://github.com/pyca/pynacl). The PyNaCl library supports the use of public key encryption using public and private keys. The following diagram depicts the basic process for using public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data.

![encryption1](../resources/enc_ex1.png)			

You can think of the role of public and private keys in public key encryption like a username and password. While it is safe to share a public key (username), you would never want to share a private key (password). When both public and private keys are combined, the public key encryption algorithm will use them to encrypt data into a format that can only be decrypted with the same public and private keys. This is the method you will use to add encryption to all posts entries and bio stored in your programs **`dsu`** file.

However, since we still want our messages to be readable from the DS website, we will also need to add support for encrypting our post information using a key that the DS server can use to decrypt messages. Fortunately, this process is nearly identical to what you will use for local encryption to your **`dsu`** file. The following diagram depicts the basic process for using public and private keys to share encrypted data.

![encryption2](../resources/enc_ex2.png)			

Rather than encrypt a message using a public key that we create, we encrypt using the public key of the source where we want to share our message. This means that we need a way to exchange public keys with the DS server. To keep things as consistent as possible, the DS organization has modified the **`token`** key used by its protocol to store the public encryption keys exchanged between client programs and the server. But more on this change a little bit later.

Your final program will contain the following new modules:

1. NaClDSEncoder.py: A helper module provided for you, complete.
2. NaClProfile.py: A template class provided for you, incomplete.
3. a4.py: The main entry point to your program. You may continue to migrate your code from a2.py and a3.py or you start fresh. If you do start fresh, you will still need to make use of the code you have written to send messages to the DS server.

To prepare your ICS32 DS program for network communication using NaCl, there are a number of tasks you must complete. They have been divided into individual parts below to help you prioritize your program requirements.

### Part 1

#### Installing the PyNaCl Package
The first thing you will need to do is install the PyNaCl package to your instance of Python:

```ipython3
pip install pynacl
```

If all goes well, you should see a message that is similar to "Successfully installed pynacl-1.4.0". To verify that the package was installed, open up your Python shell and type:

```ipython3
>>> import nacl
>>>
```

If you receive any response other than a new line of input, it's likely that pip installed the package to a different version of Python. Check your messages and make sure that you are testing the package in the same instance of the Python shell as where you installed the package.

#### Prepare your Environment

Thankfully, the DS org has released a module to abstract away some of the steps required to interact with their new encrypted platform. So the next thing you will want to do is download the module and test it. 

[ICS32 Distributed Social NaCl Encoder](https://ics32.markbaldw.in/resources/NaClDSEncoder.py)

A simple test is included in the following snippet, you are free to use it to validate that your environment is properly configured. You may also find the use of the **`NaClDSEncoder`** class in the test class a useful reference for your assignment code.

```ipython3
# NaClDSEncoder_test.py
# Simple test harness for the NaClDSEncoder class
# 
# ICS 32
# Mark S. Baldwin

import unittest
from NaClDSEncoder import NaClDSEncoder
from nacl.public import PrivateKey, PublicKey, Box

class TestNaClDSEncoder(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_generate(self):
        # create an NaClDSEncoder object
        nacl_enc = NaClDSEncoder()
        # generate new keys
        nacl_enc.generate()

        # typically in a unittest printing this way is unnecessary
        # including here for demonstration purposes...
        # use print to display the keys, notice how the keypair is 
        # just the public and private keys combined.
        print('\n')
        print(f'keypair: {nacl_enc.keypair}')
        print(f'public key: {nacl_enc.public_key}')
        print(f'private key: {nacl_enc.private_key}')

        self.assertEqual(len(nacl_enc.keypair), 88)
        self.assertEqual(nacl_enc.public_key, nacl_enc.keypair[:44])
        self.assertEqual(nacl_enc.private_key, nacl_enc.keypair[44:])
    
    def test_encode_public(self):
        # Use the NaClDSEncoder to create new keys
        test_keys = NaClDSEncoder()
        test_keys.generate()

        # Test the NaClDSEncoder using the test_keys
        nacl_enc = NaClDSEncoder()
        pkey = nacl_enc.encode_public_key(test_keys.public_key)
        self.assertEqual(type(pkey), PublicKey)
    
    def test_encode_private(self):
        # Use the NaClDSEncoder to create new keys
        test_keys = NaClDSEncoder()
        test_keys.generate()

        # Test the NaClDSEncoder using the test_keys
        nacl_enc = NaClDSEncoder()
        prvkey = nacl_enc.encode_private_key(test_keys.private_key)
        self.assertEqual(type(prvkey), PrivateKey)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

If you have everything set up properly, you should see some output that will look similar to the following (NOTE: your values will be different every time you run the **`generate()`** function!):

```ipython3
..

keypair: ziq0wkuDE0n0i+SFBtTEE1w9y/gG9C19NuAE8b8d/Qo=8ldBMVgC8QkOPl9nBKikIc+fLxUCuadqfAOXl90MoiA=
public key: ziq0wkuDE0n0i+SFBtTEE1w9y/gG9C19NuAE8b8d/Qo=
private key: 8ldBMVgC8QkOPl9nBKikIc+fLxUCuadqfAOXl90MoiA=
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

OK
```

### Part 2

For part 2, you will need to write a new class to handle the new encryption policies required by the DS org. Since the DS server will now expect your program to authenticate with a public key and send posts that have been encrypted using the DS public key, you are going to need to rethink the way your current program works. Fortunately, the Profile module that you have been using in your DS program, is still quite useful. Therefore, the best course of action is probably to subclass the Profile class. To help you with this task, you will use the following skeleton to get started:

```ipython3
# TODO: Install the pynacl library so that the following modules are available
# to your program.
import nacl.utils
from nacl.public import PrivateKey, PublicKey, Box

# TODO: Import the Profile and Post classes
# TODO: Import the NaClDSEncoder module
    
# TODO: Subclass the Profile class
class NaClProfile:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        TODO: Complete the initializer method. Your initializer should create the follow three 
        public data attributes:

        public_key:str
        private_key:str
        keypair:str

        Whether you include them in your parameter list is up to you. Your decision will frame 
        how you expect your class to be used though, so think it through.
        """
        pass

    def generate_keypair(self) -> str:
        """
        Generates a new public encryption key using NaClDSEncoder.

        TODO: Complete the generate_keypair method.

        This method should use the NaClDSEncoder module to generate a new keypair and populate
        the public data attributes created in the initializer.

        :return: str    
        """
        pass

    def import_keypair(self, keypair: str):
        """
        Imports an existing keypair. Useful when keeping encryption keys in a location other than the
        dsu file created by this class.

        TODO: Complete the import_keypair method.

        This method should use the keypair parameter to populate the public data attributes created by
        the initializer. 
        
        NOTE: you can determine how to split a keypair by comparing the associated data attributes generated
        by the NaClDSEncoder
        """
        pass

    """
    TODO: Override the add_post method to encrypt post entries.

    Before a post is added to the profile, it should be encrypted. Remember to take advantage of the
    code that is already written in the parent class.

    NOTE: To call the method you are overriding as it exists in the parent class, you can use the built-in super keyword:
    
    super().add_post(...)
    """

    """
    TODO: Override the get_posts method to decrypt post entries.

    Since posts will be encrypted when the add_post method is used, you will need to ensure they are 
    decrypted before returning them to the calling code.

    :return: Post
    
    NOTE: To call the method you are overriding as it exists in the parent class you can use the built-in super keyword:
    super().get_posts()
    """
    
    """
    TODO: Override the load_profile method to add support for storing a keypair.

    Since the DS Server is now making use of encryption keys rather than username/password attributes, you will 
    need to add support for storing a keypair in a dsu file. The best way to do this is to override the 
    load_profile module and add any new attributes you wish to support.

    NOTE: The Profile class implementation of load_profile contains everything you need to complete this TODO. Just add
    support for your new attributes.
    """

    def encrypt_entry(self, entry:str, public_key:str) -> bytes:
        """
        Used to encrypt messages using a 3rd party public key, such as the one that
        the DS server provides.

        TODO: Complete the encrypt_entry method.

        NOTE: A good design approach might be to create private encrypt and decrypt methods that your add_post, 
        get_posts and this method can call.
        
        :return: bytes 
        """
        pass
```

You can also download the [code directly if you prefer](https://ics32.markbaldw.in/resources/NaClProfile.py).

Since we will be required to send encrypted messages to the new DS server, we might as well add support for local encryption as well to prevent unwanted parties from reading our journal entries. Therefore, in this class you will extend the Profile module to not only encrypt messages that will be sent to the DS server, but also messages stored in the **`.dsu`** file.

The comments in the skeleton code will provide you with some guidance on what you need to do. In addition to the incomplete methods, you will also need to override two methods from the Profile class. If done correctly, all of your new data attributes as well as your encrypted messages will be saved to the **`.dsu`** file passed to the **`save_profile`** method, without having to change anything else!

To learn how to encrypt and decrypt information using a keypair, you will need to consult the documentation for the module. The [main page for the docs](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a good place to start if you want to learn more about PyNaCl. However, since you are only required to implement a small portion of the overall PyNaCl module, you may find the examples on the [Public Key Encryption](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public/#examples) page to be the most helpful. Feel free to discuss your findings on Zulip with your classmates.

Once your new **`Profile`** subclass has been completed, you can validate it by running the following program:


```ipython3
from Profile import Profile, Post
from NaClProfile import NaClProfile

np = NaClProfile()
kp = np.generate_keypair()
print(np.public_key)
print(np.private_key)
print(np.keypair)

# Test encryption with 3rd party public key
ds_pubkey = "jIqYIh2EDibk84rTp0yJcghTPxMWjtrt5NW4yPZk3Cw="
ee = np.encrypt_entry("Encrypted Message for DS Server", ds_pubkey)
print(ee)

# Add a post to the profile and check that it is decrypted.
np.add_post(Post("Hello Salted World!"))
p_list = np.get_posts()
print(p_list[0].get_entry())

# Save the profile
np.save_profile(PATH/TO/DSU)

print("Open DSU file to check if message is encrypted.")
input("Press Enter to Continue")

# Create a new NaClProfile object and load the dsu file.
np2 = NaClProfile()
np2.load_profile(PATH/TO/DSU)
# Import the keys
np2.import_keypair(kp)

# Verify the post decrypts properly
p_list = np2.get_posts()
print(p_list[0].get_entry())
```

Just remember that once post entries have been encrypted with a keypair, they can **only** be decrypted with the same keypair!

### Part 3

For the final part of this assignment, you will need to make sure your new authentication and encryption interface works with the udpated DS Server. There have been a few changes to the DS Server. 

<del>First, it is no longer running at the previous URL. A new URL will be provided via Slack.</del> This information is no longer relevant. Continue using the same server/port that you have been using all quarter.

Second, you will receive a slightly revised response message:

```ipython3
# join as existing or new user
{"join": {"username": "ohhimark","password": "password123","token":"my_public_key"}}
```

You might recall from previous assignments, the token key was not used during join requests with the DS server. With the new public key encryption in place, you must now perform a join request using a public key that you have generated. The DS server will then use this public key to decrypt all of the messages that you send moving forward.

You will also need to slightly adjust the way in which you use the **`token`** value that you receive from the DS Server. Under the rules of the non-encrypted DS server you were required to send the token you received from the server in all of your messages. Now, rather than send back the server token, you will send __your public key__ as the value of the token key.

```{note}
The token key in DS Protocol messages should be used to store the value of your public encryption key.
```

Finally, the only thing we are missing is a public key from the DS server. When you successfully join the server your response will now contain the public key used by the server to decrypt your messages:

```ipython3
{"response": {"type": "ok", "message": "", "token":"server_public_key"}}
```

So rather than return this response token to the server like you did in previous assignments, you will now need to store this value in your program somewhere and use it to encrypt your messages before sending. The **`encrypted_entry`** function that is part of the **`NaClProfile`** skeleton class is designed to support this requirement.

If you have implemented your **`NaClProfile`** class and modified your communication with the DS Server successfully, your program should continue to work as expected, just a little more secure.

### Part 2

For this assignment you will be given a mostly functional Tkinter program framework to get you started. Learning graphical toolkits is a big undertaking that is typically filled with a lot of trial and error. We could spend an entire quarter mastering the Tkinter toolkit if we so desired. So, rather than get bogged down attempting to work through all of the nuances of getting a Tkinter GUI to function the way we want, you will be spending your remaining time in this class extending an existing program that already works pretty well. The following image depicts the ICS 32 DS program in it's default state with a DSU file loaded.

![dsugui](../resources/ics32dsu_gui.png)

However, the version that is available for you, does not yet have the features required to get to the state pictured. To make this program fully functional, you will have to download the template and complete all of the TODO items described in the code.

```{admonition} Attention
:class: warning
The Distributed Social GUI Starter Code was updated on 7/17/21 to remove references to a version of the Profile module that we are no longer using for this course. If you are experiencing errors related to **`NaClProfile`**, please grab the latest version!

```
<a href="../resources/DistributedSocialGUI.py">The Distributed Social GUI Starter Code</a>

To get a better understanding of how this program was built, watch the lecture and walkthrough posted in the weekly notes.

```{note}
There is a lecture on Tkinter in the weekly notes page that covers the process for building this program, as well as some of the aspects of Tkinter you will need to know to complete the assignment.
```

### Extra Credit

For this final assignment in ICS32 you will have the opportunity to receive up to 3 extra credit points. To receive a signal extra credit point you must add at least one of the following features to your Tkinter GUI. You may **add up to 3** features for extra credit.

1. Add title support for posts.
2. Add a settings menu item and interface for username and password management.
3. Add a toolbar with quick buttons to insert your API keywords into the editor.
4. Add a bio menu item and interface for editing the user bio.
5. Add support for editing existing posts.
6. Add support for editing the location of the DSU server.
7. Add a custom feature (must complete at least one of the above first).

#### Add title support for posts

Currently, the GUI for the ICS 32 DS program extracts the titles for the post tree viewer from the first few characters of the post. It might be nice to provide users with the ability to write a proper title for each post and use that in the post tree viewer as well. To accomplish this feature a couple of changes must happen:
1. The Profile and Post classes must be updated to include an additional title attribute.
2. The GUI must be modified to support text editing for the title.
3. The post tree viewer widget must be updated to display post titles.

#### Add settings menu item and interface
Without a username and password, all post entries in a DSU file must be associated with either hard coded values or rely on a2 to generate a complete profile. A better approach would be to integrate the various profile settings into the GUI. To accomplish this, you will need to create a settings window that provides the user with access to input and change these values. This feature will require the following changes to be made:
1. Add a new 'settings' item to the menu.
2. Open a new window when the settings item is clicked.
3. Display current username and password in the settings window.
4. Add a Tkinter Text or Entry widget to allow the user to change their username and password.
5. Add a Tkinter button to save and close the settings window.
6. Save edited username and password to the DSU file.

#### Add a quick button toolbar for keywords
In assignment 3, you introduced support for adding content from 3rd party API's to your assignments. For this feature, you will add Tkinter buttons that insert your API data into the post entry editor. To complete this feature you will need to:
1. Add buttons to the GUI. You may either add them in the footer frame between the status label and online checkbox, create a new 'Toolbar' frame class and add it above the entry editor, or add a new menu dropdown with menu items for your keywords.
2. You must implement the @weather feature, but you may also want to include any additional API keywords you created for assignment 3.
3. When a keyword is selected, the API data should be placed at the position of the cursor in the entry editor window.

#### Add a bio menu item and editor
This feature adds support for viewing and editing the profile bio. (HINT: This feature pairs nicely with feature 2 in terms of the type and organization of code you will need to write).
1. Add a new 'bio' item to the menu.
2. Open a new window when the bio item is clicked.
3. Display current bio in the bio window.
4. Add a Tkinter Text or Entry widget to allow the user to change their bio.
5. Add a Tkinter button to save and close the bio window.
6. Save edited bio to the DSU file.

#### Add support for post editing
Currently, the post editor only adds new posts. When the Save Post button is clicked, whatever content is in the entry editor widget will be saved as a new post. A more realistic way of using this program would be to allow a user to also edit their post. There are a number of ways to go about adding this feature, here are a two:
1. Detect when an existing post has been selected and edited and change the operation of the Save Post click event to update rather than add when appropriate.
2. Add new buttons to perform different operations. An 'edit' button, for example, would update a post. Whereas a 'new' button would add a post.

#### Add support for DSU server location editing
The current implementation of the program requires you to hard code in the URL for the DSU server. However, servers come and go, and in the future your users may want to move their posts to a new location. So for this feature you will be required to add a text entry widget that allows your user to edit the URL of the DSU server. (HINT: This feature pairs nicely with feature 2 and 4 in terms of the type and organization of code you will need to write).

1. Add a new 'server' item to the menu.
2. Open a new window when the server item is clicked.
3. Display current server URL in the server window.
4. Add a Tkinter Text or Entry widget to allow the user to change their server.
5. Add a Tkinter button to save and close the server window.
6. Save edited server URL to the DSU file.

### Submitting
Upload all of your program files in a single .zip file to Canvas by the due date. NAME YOUR MAIN FILE **`a4.py`**. If you complete any of the extra credit items, be sure to add a README file that describes exactly which features you implemented. You can include the README in your zipped submission, but YOU MUST ALSO LEAVE A COMMENT IN CANVAS ON YOUR SUBMISSION THAT INDICATES YOU HAVE EXTRA CREDIT FEATURES IN YOUR PROGRAM. Failure to leave a comment means that we may not notice the extra credit features when grading.

Additionally, all modules that you create or edit must include the following comment on the first three lines:

```python3

# NAME
# EMAIL
# STUDENT ID

```

### How we will grade your submission
																		
This assignment will be graded on a 15-point scale, with the 15 points being allocated completely to whether or not you submitted something that meets all of the above requirements. The following rubric will be used:

Requirements and Function | 12 pts
: Does the program do what it is supposed to do?
: Does the program make use of the required 3rd Party module?
: Does the NaClProfile module function properly?
: Are there any bugs or errors?

Quality and Design        | 3 pts 
: Is the code well designed?
: Is the code clearly documented?

Extra Credit | 3 pts 
: Is one extra credit feature implemented and functioning as intended? 1 pt
: Is a second extra credit feature implemented and functioning as intended? 1 pt
: Is a third extra credit feature implemented and functioning as intended? 1 pt

By now you should be clearly documenting your code and expending effort to ensure that your code design follows the conventions we have been discussing throughout the class. Therefore, we will be taking a much stricter stance on quality and design than we have in previous assignments.
