Assignment 4: Extending the Platform
============================

## Introduction
In assignment 3, you learned how to write a program that connects to and shares information with a program running on another computer. The systems we write programs for today are almost always connected to other computers in some capacity. Whether it is your computer operating system sending data back to its creator, your web browser automatically downloading updates, or you reaching out to friends and family for a video chat, nearly all the programs we use today rely on networked communication to extend their capabilities.

While your Distributed Social (DS) program has the ability to accept, store, and distribute information written by your users, it doesn't yet take advantage of the vast wealth of information available to networked programs today. So for this assignment we are going to be extending the DS platform by adding some new features for the users of your program.

You have probably noticed how in programs like Slack, Discord, and Facebook Messenger, keywords can be entered into chat conversations that trigger some sort of automatic inclusion or formatting. In computer science, this process is called __transclusion__, which basically refers to the process of using a linking syntax to connect or include content from one source into the content of another. For this assignment, you will be enhancing the post writing feature you created in assignment 3 by adding support for keyword transclusion. 

By now, you should have had a chance to digest some of the core principles of networked communication. You have learned about protocols, sockets, and request/response communication with a server. Your work for assignment 4 will focus on locking in these concepts as well as exploring some new ones. 

### Summary of Program Requirements 
* Connect to and retrieve data from at least 2 web API's using Python's **`urllib`** module.
* Use transclusion to parse and replace keywords in a journal entry with content from web API's.
* Write classes to manage your APIs.

### Learning Goals
* How to work with public API's
* Know when and how to write a class
* Understand and handle failures when communicating over HTTP
* Use inheritance to extend class functionality
