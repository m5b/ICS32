Assignment 1: File Explorer
============================

## Introduction

For the rest of the assignments in this course, you will be building a distributed social communication platform. The final version of the program will allow you to send and receive encrypted messages with other students in the class. You will start with a command line interface and end with an encrypted graphical interface. Along the way you will learn about many of the processes that programmers use to develop software.
