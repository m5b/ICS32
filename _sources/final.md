Final Project: Chatting with Friends
============================

## Overview

As discussed in the course overview, you will not be required to take a midterm or final exam. Rather, we will be assessing your understanding of the course material by asking you to apply what you have learned through a final project. At this point in the class you have learned how to work with the computer file system, modules, sockets, and APIs. You have also learned how to write simple tests for your code, classes, apply recursive function calls, and handle exceptions that occur when your program runs. Therefore, your final project should build upon and extend what you have learned so far and completed in your assignments.

The final project is worth a total of 150 points, similar to what you have earned for most course assignments. However, grading for final project will be far more rigid than what you have experienced so far. You will have roughly five weeks to complete your final project, during which time we expect you to integrate everything you have learned from the work you have completed. To help you manage the final project alongside your remaining three assignments, you will be allowed to work in groups. Working in a group is __optional__ and will be limited to a __maximum of three__. 

```{note}
If you choose to work in a group you must create a team name and nominate a leader. The leader will be responsible for communication and submission. We will discuss how to submit a group assignment in class as we near the end of the quarter. DO NOT wait until the last week of class to formalize your group. Take care of this step as soon as possible.
```

For your final project you will develop a module that enables a program to send and receive direct messages with another user on the DSP platform. You will then incorporate this module into a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. There is a significant amount of work required to make this program feature complete, so you should get started early and gradually build your program step by step. To help you get started, the requirements for your final program have been divided into several parts. You are encouraged to follow each part in order. If you are working in a group, assigning a single part to each group member is a good way to divide the work equitably as each part can be written and tested independently of the final program.

```{note}

The full assignment will be released during week 6.
