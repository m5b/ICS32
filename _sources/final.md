Final Project: Chatting with Friends
============================

## Overview

As discussed in the course overview, you will not be required to take a midterm or final exam. Rather, we will be assessing your understanding of the course material by asking you to apply what you have learned through a final project. At this point in the class you have learned how to work with the computer file system, modules, sockets, and APIs. You have also learned how to write simple tests for your code, classes, apply recursive function calls, and handle exceptions that occur when your program runs. Therefore, your final project should build upon and extend what you have learned so far and completed in your assignments.

The final project is worth a total of 200 points, more than what you earn for all course assignments, which means you should target an individual project workload that is equal to or greater than what you have completed for any two assignments in the course. You will have roughly five and a half weeks to complete your final project, so take this into account when planning your work. To help you manage the final project alongside your remaining three assignments, you will be allowed to work in groups. Working in a group is __optional__ and will be limited to a __maximum of three__. 

```{note}
If you choose to work in a group you must create a team name and nominate a leader. The leader will be responsible for communication and submission. Once you have a group and name, notify your TA so that they can create a final project group for you in Canvas. DO NOT wait until the last week of class to formalize your group. Take care of this step as soon as possible.
```

Details will be released in week 5.
