### Some Thoughts

Overall, this weeks quiz was a good start! I was excited to see so many of you show up on Zoom and in Socrative. Although generally everyone performed well on the quiz, there were three questions that I think require some additional explanation. 

**Question 4**

Input arguments are string types by default. So rather than perform a mathematical operation, when the python interpreter detects a string the + operator concatenates two arguments. 
	
How would you go about changing the code to get the answer 7?


**Question 5**

A tuple is recognizable by it's structure and use of parentheses to enclose values. If you weren't sure about this one, take a look here:

**Question 6**

In python, data structures are zero-based, meaning the indexer starts at 0.  So, referencing the tuple with at position 1 will return the second value in the structure.


In future quizzes, I will use the live time to provide these types of explanations in during the quiz.
