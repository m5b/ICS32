## Week 5 Overview

Week 5: Return to the Classroom.

Guess what? By the end of this week you will be halfway done with the course! As you know, we do not have any formal labs this week. In lieu of labs, however, we recommend that you use the extra time to schedule office hours with your instructors if you are feeling uncertain about any of the material we have covered so far in the class. We change direction slightly next week as we start to explore many new topics.

We will not be releasing any new pre-recorded lectures this week. Rather, we will focus our class time on diving deeper into all the concepts learned so far in the class. If you do not regularly attend or watch Tuesday recordings, this is the week to do it!

See you in class!
