## Lecture Materials

No new lectures this week. But we will have one final live class on 3/11. If you have any issues related to assignment 5 or final project, feel free to join me on Zoom!

```{note}
Nevermind. I added one last lecture. You do not have to watch it to understand how to complete any of your assignments, but if you would like watch a deeper discussion on GUI's in general, check it out. This is recorded live with the Fall ICS 32 class so there is a brief discussion on asyncio that will seem out of place (I removed it from our assignments this quarter).
