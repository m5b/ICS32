##### Working with the Event Loop

If you recall from our live lecture in week 8, we discussed the event loop and how it is used by graphical toolkits like Tkinter. The following diagram depicts the basic process:


As events are trigger in the user interface, they are added to the event queue and then processed sequentially until the queue is empty. But what if we want to trigger some event programmatically rather than wait for the user to perform some action? In graphical programs, it is quite common to run background operations either while idle or as a user is interacting with the interface. A program may need to poll a remote service for new data, check for changes to existing data or send data somewhere, or perform some safety tasks like saving program state. In most cases, these types of tasks should not depend on the user to initiate them, but instead happen automatically.

Fortunately, most graphical toolkits provide a mechanism for adding procedures to the event queue programmatically. Tkinter's mechanism is called a __timer event__. Timer events are similar to input events like _click_, _select_, and _press_, but they can be set in code and triggered by a time based interval. The following diagram from the [Tkdocs event loop tutorial](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/eventloop.html) depicts how timer events are used in an event loop:

![Tkdocs event loop diagram](../resources/aftertimeline.png)

Notice how each timer event schedules a new timer event when it is called. In this sense, we can chain together function calls that we want to occur. But we don't have to chain different function calls, we can also simply call the same function each time. In pseudo code, a timer event that recalls a function might look something like this:

```python3

def timed_fn():
  check_mail()
	timer_event(5000, timed_fn)

timer_event(5000, timed_fn)
```

In the pseudo code above, a timer event is created that will call the **`timed_fn`** function after 5 seconds (since the parameter is in milliseconds) from the time the event loop is started. **`timed_fn`** then performs some operation like checking for new mail and adds itself back to the event loop by calling **`timer_event`** again. When run, the resulting code will then automatically call the **`check_mail`** function every 5 seconds until the program stops running.

In Tkinter, timer events can be created using the **`after`** function. **`after`** accepts a delay time, function, and function arguments as its parameters:

```python3

def after(self, ms: int, func: None = ...) -> str:
  '''
  :param ms: The delay in milliseconds before func is called.
  :param func: The function to be called when timer event is removed from the event queue
 
  :return: an id that is associated with this timer event
  '''
  pass
					
```

The **`after`** function is a member of the **`Tk`** class and can be called from any top level widget. Let's take a look at how to use a timer event in Tkinter by modifying the start code for [assignment 5](../assignments/a5.md). Comments have been removed for brevity.

```python3
main = tk.Tk()
main.title("ICS 32 Distributed Social Demo")

main.geometry("720x480")
main.option_add('*tearOff', False)

MainApp(main)

main.update()
main.minsize(main.winfo_width(), main.winfo_height())

main.mainloop()
```

Since **`main`** is the top level widget for the starter code, we will need to place the call to after from it. We will also assume that there is a method in the **`MainApp`** class that we will want to call using a timer event, so we will need to assign the **`MainApp`** instance to a variable that we can use with the timer.

```python3
main = tk.Tk()
main.title("ICS 32 Distributed Social Demo")

main.geometry("720x480")
main.option_add('*tearOff', False)

app = MainApp(main)

main.update()
main.minsize(main.winfo_width(), main.winfo_height())

main.after(5000, app.check_something) 
main.mainloop()
```

The changes here mean that now once the main loop starts, in 5 seconds the **`check_something`** method of the **`MainApp`** class will be added to the event queue and called in turn. Next, let's look at the implementation of the **`check__something`** method.

```python3
def check_something(self):
    # perform some operation
    
    self.root.after(5000,self.check_something)
```

If you look at starter code, you will notice that when the **`MainApp`** class is instantiated, the top level widget is passed as an initialization parameter and then assigned to the class attribute **`root`**. In the method above, since **`root`** is the same object as **`main`** from the earlier code snippet, it is used to place a new timer event on the event queue by calling the **`after`** function again. If we run this starter code with these updates, then every 5 seconds the **`check_something`** function will be called.

What if we need to stop this operation?

For long running timer events, there may be a desire to cancel them at some point. For example, you might decide that automatically running an operation in the background is something that your user should have control over. So perhaps an _auto check_ option or simply a _cancel_ button is a better way to design your program. Timer events can be cancelled by keeping track of the id returned from each call to **`after`**. The timer associated with a particular **`id`** can be destroyed by placing a call to **`after_cancel`**:

```python3
					
def after_cancel(self, id: str) -> None:
  '''
  :param id: The id that is associated with the timer event to be cancelled
  '''
  pass

```

Whether or not you need to make use of after_cancel is largely up to you and your program design. We won't go into detail on how to go about implementing cancel support here, but it's good to know that cancelling a running timer event is possible.

Note that working with timer events is often not as straightforward as it seems in this lecture. In the use cases for this class, the implementations covered here are sufficient. However, as program complexity grows and more events move on and off the queue either through widget interaction or timer events, bugs can appear. So before you start adding tens of timer events to your future programs, take some time to learn about the complexities of the event loop. For this class, we just want to give you the beginning pathways for completing operations like the ones you are asked to complete in your assignments, rather than overwhelm you with the complexities of managing multiprocess operations.
