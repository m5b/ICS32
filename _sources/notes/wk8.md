### Thursday Live Class

In the live class for this week, lecture primarily centered around the Tkinter graphical toolkit and requirements for a5. 

NOTE: The first part of this lecture has no audio. I will re-record the lecture slides with audio for week 9. You can skip to ~16:00 minute mark for the start of audio.
